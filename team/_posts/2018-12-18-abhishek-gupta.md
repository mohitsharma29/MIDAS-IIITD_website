I am an Undergraduate Researcher in the Computer Science Department at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi under the guidance of Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah. I am interested in using deep learning for solving social issues and just doing some fun projects. I am a fan of books, anime and all things informative.
