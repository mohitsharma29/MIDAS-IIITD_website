I am a computer science student and love programming. I prefer working on impactful things, especially those that lie at the intersection of several domains. My broad research interests are multimodal research (extending over all domains - eeg, text, video, audio, discrete graphs), computer automation and work with modern AI tools like deep learning and machine learning. Other than research I love open source software, am a bookworm, skygazer, nature-lover and a gamer.
