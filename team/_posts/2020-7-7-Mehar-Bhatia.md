Hi there, 

I am a full-time Research Assistant at MIDAS Lab, IIIT-Delhi under the guidance of Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah. I hold a B.Tech degree (Batch of 2020) in Computer Science (minor in Mathematics) from Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida. My research interest lies in NLP, Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing.
