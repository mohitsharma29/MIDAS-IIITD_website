"Can machines be as creative as us?" 
--- A question I used to ponder upon while designing computer graphics, led me towards the field of artificial intelligence.

Having worked for more than 2 years at labs of national importance (CSIR and ISRO); building projects for the Government of India's AI Mission Phase-1; collaborating with tech-giants catering their product needs; I explored a fair deal of the development and deployment side of what AI has to offer --- primarily within Computer Vision, Remote Sensing, and Deep Learning.

I know they learn what you teach them. Mostly, they learn what you don't teach them. It's about asking the right questions to the right data.
But my question remains unanswered.
Finding the answer with MIDAS.
