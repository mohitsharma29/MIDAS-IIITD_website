I believe that having a growth mindset and humility with a little bit of creativity and time management can help you achieve anything you desire. I realised that world will always be facing problems (sorry no utopia) and mostly digital in the coming future or problems that can be influenced and sorted by digital/technological means. At least for the next 5 years my primary goal is to gain skills to solve such problems and bring change in the world. Though there's a big list of other things I want to achieve or experience in my life (If interested, send me a mail. I'll forward it to you).

Life is not short, You just gotta DO MORE.
