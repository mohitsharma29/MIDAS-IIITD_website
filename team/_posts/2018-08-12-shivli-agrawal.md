I am Shivli, currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft and a B.E. Computer Science graduate from NSIT, batch of 2018. I am into DL architectures for a while and would love to dive deeper. I have done some basic projects related to NLP and am enthusiastic about expanding my skill set and learning more. Happy to be here :).
