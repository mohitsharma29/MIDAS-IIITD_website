I have joined MIDAS lab at IIIT Delhi as a Reaserch Assistant on 1st August 2019. Currently I am working on the project titled, "ASR systems and its Applications", by primarily focusing on extraction
and analysis of emotions from human speech. Prior to joining MIDAS, I was a Research Intern at Design and Innovation Centre (DIC), UIET, Panjab University. My research interest lies in the broad area 
of application of AI for social good. I am interested to work on designing human-assistive machines or systems which are both emotionally and socially aware of its surroundings, which is essential for 
its effective interactions with humans and with other machines. I believe empowering systems with adaptive interaction ability can improve the quality of life in health and social care.
