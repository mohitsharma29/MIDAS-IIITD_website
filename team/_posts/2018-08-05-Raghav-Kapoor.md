I am an undergraduate student from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi with great academic record and position and have been awarded merit scholarship for the same. I am a hardworking and passionate student and have keen interest in the field of Artificial Intellignce and currently working as a research intern in the MIDAS Labs IIITD where I work on projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, Data Mining and Computer Vision. I have also published a research paper titled "Mind Your Language : Abuse and Offense Detection using Code-Switched Language" in the prestigious conference AAAI - 19. 

I am an avid learner, programmer and love problem solving and would wish to contribute using my cerebral abilities and skills for an intellectual experience in the field of programming. I have also interned in Goldman Sachs as a software analyst and have great experience in the field of coding. Furthermore, I have won many coding contests for which I have been awarded cash prizes and also a problem setter at various competitive coding websites. Apart from the academic interests, I also have a keen interest in swimming and debating, and have participated in many contests right from the school days. I strongly believe that one must be in a continuous process of learning as "Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident" - Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam.
