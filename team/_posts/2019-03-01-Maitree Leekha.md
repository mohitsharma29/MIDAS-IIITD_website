The boundless possibility of trying out and the instant knowledge of the outcome that stimulates one for further analysis of a rationale in question is what I find most appealing about Computer Science. Keeping up an inquisitive and explorative attitude, I believe, leads to a constant learning process. This approach adds to the already immense potential for innovation that exists in this field.

Hello there!
I am Maitree Leekha, a third year undergraduate student, pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science from Delhi Technological University, erstwhile Delhi College of Engineering; and since who so ever is reading this has probably already gone through my education and skills, I wonâ€™t talk much about that!

In this era of technology, realizing how much our lives have been transformed by harnessing this powerful resource reinforces my unending urge to explore more!

When I watch videos of Google adding some new element to their product or even when I log into Facebook every day and come up with some new feature, what I feel is a sense of marvel. Here are innovations that keep evolving not only technically but also hold infinite scope for creativity and logic. I feel a similar sense of exhilaration when I see my code run successfully. It is this feeling, which till date, drives me to not give up on even the toughest of problems.

My period in this industry has just started, but even in this short span, I surely have strengthened my roots to some extent by means of my internships. I am of a firm belief that, driven by the fire of knowledge, what one can learn from herself, lays the strong foundation and forms the stepping stones for something extremely iconic. I am currently walking around with data science, machine learning and deep learning. These areas of artificial intelligence surprisingly seem to interest me, a front end person, quite a lot.

I also love painting and capturing the world as I see it, into the pages of my art book.
