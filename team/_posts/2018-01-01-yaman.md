I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at MIDAS-Lab (website rarely updated) in IIIT-D, advised by Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah.

My research revolves around Adversarial Networks, Meta-learning, QA and Speech. I am particularly interested in the business and public policy side of these things.

I am also an Artificial Intelligence research scholar for companies like Benesse Corp and Berlitz Inc.

In the daytime, I churn out software for Adobe.
