I am third-year student at NSIT Delhi with research interests in NLP, Computer Vision, Adversarial Training. Currently working at MIDAS Labs under Dr.Rajiv Ratn Shah and collaborators from Bloomberg AI Dr.Debanajan Mahata and Mr.Raymond Zhang on developing GANs for keyphrase generation. To our knowledge, this is the first effort in the research community to apply GANs to problem of keyphrase generation. We are constantly developing new discriminator architectures and improving upon previous results, currently our GAN model has been able to beat state-of-the-art in predicting absent key phrases .
