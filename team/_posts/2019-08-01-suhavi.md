I am a final year, Computer Science Undergrad at IIIT-Delhi.
In the vast domain of the Machine Learning,more than the technology itself, itâ€™s the problem statements that interest me.
At Midas, I am working on user-based depression detection model , based on a social media databases, hoping it leads to early help provision to those who need it.
