The future is with Intelligent and Autonomous System capable of behaving akin to humans. With this belief I have decided to pursue my interest in coupling
Computer Vision, Machine Vision and Deep learning to create practical applications and making current techniques more intelligent. I have been a researcher at MIDAS since January 2018 and have worked on many projects and published at International Conferences like IEEE WACV, ISM and ALW, SMM4H at EMNLP. I am currently a Master's student at the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV). Reach out to me on my email ID for collaborating on projects involving deep learning, computer vision, bio medical images and other machine learning  or even to just have discussions and debates about all the great ideas that may pop into your mind.
