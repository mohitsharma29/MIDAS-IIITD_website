# Abstract

Social media platforms are increasingly being used for study-ing  psycho-linguistic  phenomenon  to  model  expressions  ofsuicidal intent in tweets. Most recent work in suicidal ideationdetection doesnâ€™t leverage contextual psychological cues. Inthis work, we hypothesize that the contextual information em-bedded in the form of historical activities of users and ho-mophily  networks  formed  between  like-minded  individualsin Twitter can substantially improve existing techniques forautomated identification of suicidal tweets. This premise isextensively tested to yield state of the art results as comparedto linguistic only models, and the state-of-the-art model
