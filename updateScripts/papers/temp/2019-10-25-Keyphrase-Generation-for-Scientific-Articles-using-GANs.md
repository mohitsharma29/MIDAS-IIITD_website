# Abstract

n  this  paper,  we  present  a  keyphrase  generation  ap-proach  using  conditional  Generative  Adversarial  Net-works (GAN). In our GAN model, the generator outputsa sequence of keyphrases based on the title and abstractof a scientific article. The discriminator learns to distin-guish  between  machine-generated  and  human-curatedkeyphrases.  We  evaluate  this  approach  on  standardbenchmark  datasets.  Our  model  achieves  state-of-the-art performance in generation of abstractive keyphrasesand is also comparable to the best performing extractivetechniques. We also demonstrate that our method gener-ates more diverse keyphrases and make our implemen-tation publicly available
