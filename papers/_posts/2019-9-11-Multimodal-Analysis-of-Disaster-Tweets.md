# Abstract

Social media is inevitably the most abundant source
of actionable information in times of natural disasters. Most
of the data is either available in the form of text, images or
videos. Real-time analysis of such data during the events of
calamities poses many challenges to machine learning algorithms
that require a large amount of data to perform well. Multimodal
Twitter Dataset for Natural Disasters (CrisisMMD) is one such
novel dataset that provides annotated textual as well as image
data to researchers to aid the development of crisis response
mechanism which can leverage social media platforms to extract
useful information in times of crisis. In this paper, we analyze
multimodal data related to seven different natural calamities like
hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, etc. and propose a novel decision
diffusion technique to classify them into informative and noninformative categories. The proposed methodology outperforms
the text baselines by more than 4% accuracy and image baselines
by more than 3%
