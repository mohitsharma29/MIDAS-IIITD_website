# Abstract

Twitter is a social media platform where users express opinions over a variety of issues. Posts offering grievances or complaints can be utilized by private/ public organizations to improve their service and promptly gauge a low-cost assessment. In this paper, we propose an iterative methodology which aims to identify complaint based posts pertaining to the transport domain. We perform comprehensive evaluations along with releasing a novel dataset for the research purposes.
