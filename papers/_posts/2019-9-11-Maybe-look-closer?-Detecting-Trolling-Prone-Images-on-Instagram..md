# Abstract

Improvement in network infrastructure and smartphones have made images based social media platforms like Instagram and Flickr popular. The visual medium of communication has also led to an alarming increase in trolling incidents on social media. Though it is crucial to automatically detect trolling incidents on social media, in this paper, we look at the problem from the eye of prevention rather than detection. A system that can recognize trolling prone images can issue a warning to users before the content is posted online and prevent potential trolling incidents. We attempt to make a supervised classifier to detect trolling prone images and discuss why the conventional state-of-the-art image classification method does not work well for this task. We also provide an extensive analysis of trolling patterns in images from Instagram, discuss challenges and possible future paths in detail.
