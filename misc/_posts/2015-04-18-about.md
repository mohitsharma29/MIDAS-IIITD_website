# Design and Implementation

I was inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s and [Allan Drummond]'s clean, elegant, and functional site. More than inspired--I've copied many aspects of his site, from visual design to conceptual organization to under-the-hood code, at Drummond's ([public]) invitation. Rather than branching his code, I started from a different boilerplate, and adopted/adapted bits of his code during customization.

Keeping with a major Jekyll Bootstrap idea, the site separates content and presentation. Presentation information is stored in a new theme, the `lab` theme, which may be useful to other research groups setting up sites.

By using [Sass] for stylesheets, the site gets virtually all the advantages of using [Less], while exploiting native Sass support in [GitHub Pages]. The site uses [Google Fonts] as well, primarily [Open Sans].

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd appreciate attribution and a link back [here](https://midas.iiitd.edu.in/about.html).
